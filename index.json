PI Web API parses the information and sends it configured PI Systems for the OMF endpoint. The static data is used to create a hierarchy on a PI AF server similar to the following: The dynamic health data is actually time-series data that is stored in PI points on a PI Data Archive and can be seen in the AF hierarchy as PI Point Data Reference attributes. OSIsoft Cloud Services currently does not have a way to store the static metadata. For OCS-based adapter health endpoints, only the dynamic data will be stored.

For content structure, see Modbus TCP data source examples . For a table of all available parameters, see Modbus TCP data source parameters . Save the file, for example as DataSource.config.json . Use any of the Configuration tools capable of making HTTP requests to execute a POST command with the contents of that file to the following endpoint: http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/<adapterId>/DataSource/ . Note: The following example uses Modbus1 as the adapter component name. For more information on how to add a component, see System components configuration . 5590 is the default port number. If you selected a different port number, replace it with that value. Example using curl (run this command from the same directory where the file is located): curl -d \"@DataSource.config.json\" -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST \"http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/Modbus1/DataSource\" Modbus TCP data source schema The full schema definition for the Modbus data source configuration is in the Modbus_DataSource_schema.json located here: Windows: %ProgramFiles%\\OSIsoft\\Adapters\\Modbus\\Schemas Linux: /opt/OSIsoft/Adapters/Modbus/Schemas Modbus TCP data source parameters The following parameters are available for configuring a Modbus TCP data source.

    "title": "OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP supported features",
    "keywords": "OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP supported features This adapter provides several features including register and data types as well as bitmaps. Register types The Modbus TCP adapter supports 6 register types, corresponding to 4 function codes (1-4). Since one function code can return two types of registers, either 16-bit or 32-bit depending on the device, either the register type or the register type code is required when configuring the data selection for the adapter. The following table lists all the register types supported in the Modbus TCP adapter. Register Type Register Type Code Description Function Code Coil 1 Read Coil Status 1 Discrete 2 Read Discrete Input Status 2 Holding16 3 Read 16-bit Holding Registers 3 Holding32 4 Read 32-bit Holding Registers 3 Input16 6 Read 16-bit Input Registers 4 Input32 7 Read 32-bit Input Registers 4 When reading from function codes 1 and 2 , the adapter expects these to be returned as single bits. For function codes 3 and 4 , the adapter expects 16 bits to be returned from devices that contain 16-bit registers and 32 bits to be returned from devices that contain 32-bit registers. Data types The Modbus TCP adapter converts readings from single or multiple registers into the data types specified by the data type code and populates the value into streams. The following table lists all data types with their corresponding type codes supported by the Modbus TCP adapter. Data type code Data type name Value type Register type Description 1 Boolean Bool Bool 0 = false 1 = true 10 Int16 Int16 Bool/16-bit Read 1 Modbus TCP register and interpret as a 16-bit integer. Bytes [BA] read from the device are stored as [AB]. 20 UInt16 UInt16 Bool/16-bit Read 1 Modbus TCP register and interpret as an unsigned 16-bit integer. Bytes [BA] read from the device are stored as [AB]. 30 Int32 Int32 16-bit/32-bit Read 32 bits from the Modbus TCP device and interpret as a 32-bit integer. Bytes [DCBA] read from the device are stored as [ABCD]. 31 Int32ByteSwap Int32 16-bit/32-bit Read 32 bits from the Modbus TCP device and interpret as a 32-bit integer. Bytes [BADC] read from the device are stored as [ABCD]. 100 Float32 Float32 16-bit/32-bit Read 32 bits from the Modbus TCP device and interpret as a 32-bit float. Bytes [DCBA] read from the device are stored as [ABCD]. 101 Float32ByteSwap Float32 16-bit/32-bit Read 32 bits from the Modbus TCP device and interpret as a 32-bit float. Bytes [BADC] read from the device are stored as [ABCD]. 110 Float64 Float64 16-bit/32-bit Read 64 bits from the Modbus TCP device and interpret as a 64-bit float. Bytes [HGFEDCBA] read from the device are stored as [ABCDEFGH]. 111 Float64ByteSwap Float64 16-bit/32-bit Read 64 bits from the Modbus TCP device and interpret as a 64-bit float. Bytes [BADCFEHG] read from the device are stored as [ABCDEFGH]. 1001 - 1250 String String 16-bit/32-bit 1001 reads a one-character string, 1002 reads a two-character string, and 1003 reads a three-character string and so on. Bytes [AB] are interpreted as \"AB\". 2001 - 2250 StringByteSwap String 16-bit/32-bit 2001 reads a one-character string, 2002 reads a two-character string, and 2003 reads a three-character string and so on. Bytes [BA] are interpreted as \"AB\". Apply bitmap The Modbus TCP adapter supports applying bitmaps to the value converted from the readings from the Modbus TCP devices. A bitmap is a series of numbers used to extract and reorder bits from a word register. The format of the bitmap is uuvvwwxxyyzz, where uu, vv, ww, yy, and zz each refer to a single bit. A leading zero is required if the referenced bit is less than 10. The low-order bit is 01 and high-order bit is either 16 or 32. Up to 16 bits can be referenced for a 16-bit word (data types 10 and 20) and up to 32 bits can be referenced for a 32-bit word (data type 30 and 31). For example, the bitmap 0307120802 will map the second bit of the original word to the first bit of the new word, the eighth bit to the second bit, the twelfth bit to the third bit, and so on. The high-order bits of the new word are padded with zeros if they are not specified. Not all data types support applying bitmap. The data types supporting bitmap are: Int16 (Data type code 10) UInt16 (Data type code 20) Int32 (Data type code 30 and 31) Apply data conversion The Modbus TCP adapter supports applying data conversion to the value converted from reading the Modbus TCP devices. A conversion factor and conversion offset can be specified. The conversion factor is used for scaling the value up or down, and the conversion offset is used for shifting the value. The mathematical equation used in conversion is the following: <After Conversion> = <Before Conversion> / Factor - Offset Not all data types support applying data conversion. Data types that support data conversion are: Int16 (Data type code 10) UInt16 (Data type code 20) Int32 (Data type code 30 and 31) Float32 (Data type code 100 and 101) The value with data conversion applied will always be converted to the 32-bit float type to maintain the precision of the conversion factor and conversion offset."

    "keywords": "OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP principles of operation This adapters's operations focus on data collection and streams creation. Adapter configuration In order for the Modbus TCP adapter to be ready for data collection, you need to configure the adapter by defining the following: Data source: Provide the data source from which the adapter should collect data. Data selection: Perform selection of Modbus TCP items to which the adapter should subscribe for data. Logging: Set up the logging attributes to manage the adapter logging behavior. For more details, see OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP data source configuration and OSIsoft Adapter for Modbus TCP data selection configuration . Connection The Modbus TCP adapter communicates with the Modbus TCP devices through the TCP/IP network by sending request packets that are constructed based on the data selection configurations, and collects the response packets returned by the devices. Stream creation From the parsed data selection configurations, the Modbus TCP adapter creates types, streams and data based on the information provided. For each measurement in the data selection configuration, a stream is created to store time series data. Data collection The Modbus TCP adapter collects data from the Modbus TCP devices at the polling rates that you specify. The rates are set in each of the data selection configurations and can range from 0 milliseconds (as fast as possible) up to 1 day per polling. The adapter automatically optimizes the data collection process by grouping the requests to reduce the I/O load imposed to the Modbus TCP networks. Streams by Modbus TCP adapter For each data selection configuration, the Modbus TCP adapter creates a stream with two properties. The properties are described in the following table: Property name Data type Description Timestamp String The response time of the stream data from the Modbus TCP device. Value Specified by the data selection The value of the stream data from the Modbus TCP device. There is a unique identifier (Stream ID) for each stream created for the selected measurement. If a custom stream ID is specified for the measurement in the data selection configuration, the Modbus TCP adapter will use that stream ID to create the stream. Otherwise, the connector constructs the stream ID using the following format: <Adapter Component ID>.<Unit ID>.<Register Type>.<Register Offset> Note: Naming convention is affected by StreamIdPrefix and ApplyPrefixToStreamID settings in data source configuration.

While the files are accessible to view, OSIsoft recommends that you use REST or the edgecmd command line tool for any changes you make to the files. As part of making adapters as secure as possible, any passwords or secrets that you configure are stored in encrypted form (with cryptographic key material stored separately in a secure location.) If you edit the files directly, the adapter may not work as expected. Note: You can edit any single component or facet of the system using REST, but also configure the system as a whole with a single REST call.

Messages with a severity below the level set are not included. The log levels in their increasing order of severity are as follows: Trace, Debug, Information, Warning, Error, Critical. For detailed information about the logLevels, see LogLevel . logFileSizeLimitBytes Optional integer The maximum size in bytes of log files that the service will create for the component. It must be a positive integer. logFileCountLimit Optional integer The maximum number of log files that the service will create for the component. It must be a positive integer. LogLevel Level Description Trace Logs that contain the most detailed messages. These messages may contain sensitive application data like actual received values, which is why these messages shouldn’t be enabled in production environment. Debug Logs that can be used to troubleshoot data flow issues by recording metrics and detailed flow related information. Information Logs that track the general flow of the application. Any non-repetitive general information (like version information relating to the software at startup, what external services are being used, data source connection string, number of measurements, egress URL, change of state “Starting”, “Stopping”, or configuration) can be useful for diagnosing potential application errors. Warning Logs that highlight an abnormal or unexpected event in the application flow, but does not otherwise cause the application execution to stop. Warning messages can indicate an unconfigured data source state, that a communication with backup failover instance has been lost, an insecure communication channel in use, or any other event that could require attention, but that does not impact data flow. Error Logs that highlight when the current flow of execution is stopped due to a failure. These should indicate a failure in the current activity, not an application-wide failure. This can indicate an invalid configuration, unavailable external endpoint, internal flow error, and so on. Critical Logs that describe an unrecoverable application or system crash, or a catastrophic failure that requires immediate attention. This can indicate application wide failures like beta timeout expired, unable to start self-hosted endpoint, unable to access vital resource (for example, Data Protection key file), and so on.

Modbus TCP is a commonly available communication protocol used for connecting and transmitting information between industrial electronic devices. The Modbus TCP adapter can connect to any device that uses the Modbus TCP communication protocol. The OSIsoft Modbus TCP Adapter is installed with a download kit obtained from the OSIsoft Customer Portal and works on devices running either Windows or Linux operating systems. All functions of the adapter are configured using JSON files. For data ingress, an adapter system component must be defined for each device to which the adapter will connect. Each adapter system component is then configured with the connection information for the device, the data to collect, and the security for the connection. For data egress, configurations are needed to specify the destination for the data and the security for the outgoing connection. Additional configurations are available to egress health and diagnostics data, add data buffering to protect against data loss, and record logging information for troubleshooting. Once the adapter is configured and sending data, use administration functions to manage the adapter or individual ingress components of the adapter. Use health and diagnostics functions to monitor the status of connected devices, adapter system functions, the number of active data streams, the rate of data ingress, the rate of errors, and the rate of data egress. The EdgeCmd utility is an OSIsoft proprietary command line tool that is used to configure and administer an adapter on both Linux and Windows operating systems. It is installed separately from the adapter and provides an alternative to REST tools."
